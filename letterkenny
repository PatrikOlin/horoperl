Hats off to Tanis, boys.

It's certainly a great day
for Thunder Bay.

Yeah, Tanis has
outdones herself.

She sure did.

Say, where is Tanis?

Well, Tanis the.

Tough gal.

Homewrecker.

Rocket. Sniper.

Alpha female.

Temptress.

A bits rough around the edges.

Tried to lure you
in to the barn for a...

Round of the bases.

Homewrecking.

Slam. Crush.

Roll in the hay.

Lay in the biblical sense.

Toe curl.

And the truth is
you kinda wanted to...

Pet heavily.

Wreck your home?

Rack up a kill.
Score a take down.

Have the best sex of your life.

Fondle?

Become one.

But you didn't.
Because that's not what a...

Good 'ol boy.

Real man.

Straight shooter. Team player.

Seriously?

God-fearing gentleman.

Stand up guy.

Does.

On the contrary, a...

Good 'ol boy.

Real man.

Straight shooter. Team player.

Pussy.

God-fearing gentleman.

Stands-up guy.

Doesn't cheat.

So while you walked towards the barn for what one
would assume was a...

Poke.

Terrible fucking idea.

Easy kill. Quick mash.

Whatever you are into, baby.

Lustful encounter.

Out of characters undertaking.

You didn't.

You got in the truck,
drove over to Rosie's and...

Now, Rosie is a...

Real pretty gal.

So fucking cute.

Ten. Damn.

Book reader.

Goddess.

Fine woman.

You can't be with one woman

and have feelings for another.

You are of the opinion
that cheaters are...

In the wrong.

Like, 95% in the wrong.

Bad? Or...

Seduced. Fair and square.

Antagonized.

Likelies a good persons
who just mades a mistake.

And you shouldn't very well
go down that road.

So...

Here's the thing...

Okay, you go.

No, you go.
Okay, I'll go.

I'm gonna move to the city.

You are gonna move to the city?

I'm gonna move to the city.

- What city?
- Vancouver.

Well, you won't get many random snowy summer nights
like this in Vancouver.

Nope. So what's in Vancouver?

Pit bull rescue.

I'm tired of reading about it every day.
I wanna help.

You're a great fucking gal,
Rosie.

You're a great fucking dude,
Wayne.

When will I see you?

When you see me. Good enough.

And that's what
a get out of jail free card looks like.

Boy, howdy.

Well, I should say.

Sick buddy. Sick, bro.

Can we bang now?

Wonderous!

I likes Monopoly.

So, as for Tanis...

Get after it.

Sure.

Killzone? Poundtown?

We should be banging right now.

Tanis.

You could do much worse,
good buddy.

You and Tanis are gonna give her
the old college try.

Good enough.

Good stuff.

Finally, a non-summer weddings.

I'm smilings.

Well, it seems
a little bit unfair

that at summer weddings gals get to wear
a nice, breezy summer dress

and then we're stuck
being sweaty

and sticky in some
three-piece wool suit.

I guess it can gets
quites pongies down there.

- Yeah, it can get a bit moist.
- No.

Who do you think is gonna moist the Stanley Cup,
this year, Katy?

I'm thinking Calgary.
I swear to fucking Christ.

Oh, did you
never see Moist Story?

Or Moist Story 2,
starring Tim Allen and Tom Hanks?

- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- I will fight you.

We don't fight at weddings.

So, Dary, are you gonna be
wearing your dad's suit?

Do falling timbers make tambers?

- Who the fuck are you?
- Yes, Katy.

I got it for a grade 13 semi-formal
from the Letterkenny Op shop.

- Loves the Op shops.
- I'll take the Sally Ann.

D'you wanna know what?
That suit is so dad the last time you wore it,

it told me the Dire Straits
were the greatest band of all time.

That suit is so dad

it ate all the lunch meat
on the way home from the grocery store.

The suit is so dad it owns a VHS
copy of The Hunt for Red October.

So, Dan, are you gonna
cold rock a kilt?

Like my Grandpas
and his grandpas before him.

A little class, a little sass

and a lot of ass all in one
tartans garments.

Wayne, I assume you'll be wearing one
of only two suits that you own.

Two will do you. One for weddings
and one for funerals.

A good suit lasts you the rest of your life
if you take care of it.

What would you wear for a court appearance?
I've never been arrested.

What would you wear to a job interviews?
I've only ever had one job.

What would you wear to a bar mitzvah?
Not Jewish.

Bat mitzvahs? Still not Jewish.

Graham's from the city.

So there's gonna be
a lot of citiots at this thing.

I fucking hate citiots.

They're always going on
about how we're saying,

"fucking mutton in our
fucking hammies".

Fucking riding our sleds down to
a fucking pit party, bud.

Giving her tits.

I was climbing the ladder up the hay mound
behind your brother and ew!

Ripped a fart that sounded like
a creaky door opening

inside a hot air balloon, but...

We do not fight at weddings.

No, but we can get laid
if we're keen to.

Sexy just wafts around
at weddings.

Plenty of opportunities
for people looking to do some yessing.

A little bit
of wedding spreading.

A little bit of matrimonies
and hide the balonies.

Oh, sure, maybe some exchanging of rings
and rubbing of things.

Clear eyes.

Full Windsors.

Can't lose.

Clean up well, Cowboy.

Well, a good suit will last the rest of your life
if you take care of it.

And me?

Well, I wouldn't kick you out of bed for eating
fucking crackers, Tanis.

Top shelf ceremony, boys.

Short, sweet
and not too much God.

I'm told God doesn't have much time
for gays these days, so...

Par for the course, I guess.

Real prouds of Dax and Ronsford
jumps in the brooms like that.

Good guys. Good grooms.

I wonder what that must be like.

What? Getting hitched?

No, being into dudes.
I've got so many questions.

Yeah, and I wanna hear
exactly zero of them.

It's like, what if you
are attracted

to somebody
with the same name as you?

Is it like, "How fun"?

Or is it fucking weird?
lt'd be fucking weird.

Quite likely.
That's never happened to me.

Guess the closest I ever came to it was almost doing it
with a gal named Sheryl.

Yeah, I suppose
it'd kindsa be like the time.

I almost hooked up with a gal who had
the same names as my Grandmas.

That would be
fucking off-putting.

It was. lt was distracting
at inappropriate times...

With...

Ruth.

I wish there was a goddamn way
I could do it with a Katy.

Ew! Or a Kate or a Caitlin.

I guess Katherine would even be
walking the line.

There's no way I could do it
with a Wayne.

Ew! Unless it was Gretzky
or Rostad.

Or Newton.

I'd bow to the great ones.
I'd bend right over.

I'd like Gretzky
in my office behind the net.

I'd be a jar of curry in a fucking hurry just
feeding him all night long.

I promised Mess
I wouldn't do this.

I just promised to mess.

I'd let Gretzk leave my ass
seriously McSorely

I'd let that lady
Bing lady bang me.

That's 69 with 99 into overtime.

I'd just straight up
let him 99 me.

Howdy who. Ah, what's a 99?

It's just fucking
while spooning.

All right, boys.

Show me what you can do
with a cock.

Hail!

Hey-ho.

Oh, good day, lads.

Did you ride
your fucking sleds here?

Oh, are you fucking matting her?

Is she a charity ride,
like, "Holy Fuck"?

Just about clear putting it
in the fucking rhubarb.

Yous just gonna stand there
rubbing your peckers or what?

Oh, she's fucking tits, eh?

D'you give her beans, bud?
D'you give her boots, bud?

Do you give her fucking torque?

Do you wanna get fucking smoke?

Or are you taking her easy?

If she's easy,
take her twice, bud.

We'll call you toonie two times.

Let's do her manure.

Isn't this the part where you...
We don't fight at weddings.

Those citiots can fucking tie
their dicks in a knot.

They can go piss up a rope.

Gretzky, Rostad
and Newton for Katy, eh?

I'm surprised Lil Wayne
didn't make the cut.

What?

Great dress, Bonnie. Thanks.

Op Shop.

You look like
the girl who punched my V ticket.

What's your nationality?

You ever seen the back seat
of a BMW X3?

You should be honored.
My buddy here only fucks tens.

Only tens. Right in the X.

Seriously, come outside.
I'll show you the 3.

It's actually the exact same
as the 5.

X5.

BMW.

Just way better on gas.

Living the Beem.

Stewart, I knowyou are the world's
foremost fire selector,

but this is a wedding and I promised the grooms
we'd play songs like.

Brown Eyed Girl and Shout
and Lean on Me,

Ain't No Mountain High Enough
andMambo No. 5.

Yous guys got the Chicken Dance
ready to play yet?

I fucking love that song,
I'll tell you.

I put it on in the barn for the cluckers
when them pecker-faced bastards

ain't dropping eggs,
I just love it.

Are you being facetious? Huh?

Can your vestigial minds even comprehend the derogatory
nature of your requests?

Or maybe you could compromise?

Do something cool like beat juggle
the Chicken Dance?

Here, take...

Enough!

Deejaying is an art form.

A medium in which the most prolific audio auteurs
of our time can speak through.

A deep connection
of the soul of yourself

and the gyrating asses
of the great unwashed

who eagerly thirst
for your deafening compositions.

I like gyrating assesbut I'm pretty sure
it ain't art there, bud.

Yeah, wouldn't you have to
have written the songs yourself for it to be art?

I'm sorry, composed?

I think the word is produced.

Right, or at least didn't download off the lnternet
so you could profit off them.

Yeah, you are more like an art dealer
than an artiste.

Or like an art gallery curator.

Selling stolen paintings.

That you printed
off the lnternet.

Whoa!

If you do not fall back,

and fasten that lip.

Your other, thinner lip.

I'll turn this elegant, soigne ceremony
of the coming together of two bonded souls

into a straight up blood rain.

Hey! Over here.

Chicken Dance.

Get it?

Just wanna go.

Good game you fucking beauties.

Way to tape your
sticks together, boys.

You two make a hot pairing.

Five minute major and a lifetime misconduct
for butt ending.

You boys enjoying yourselves?

Acting single. Seeing double.

Drinking triples.

Daxy, I gotta say,

solid work on the big city
slam prospects.

Solid big city
slam scouting, Daxy.

Boys, a little, uh,
players only here.

You are not pulling tonight.

Yes, we are.

These are modern city gals.

None of them have any interest
in hockey player types.

Boys, big muscles haven't
been popular with the ladies since Jersey Shore.

The only way to getany attention from a
cosmopolitan, college gal type

is to get in touch
with your inner twink.

You need to be less
power forward

and more power bottom.

We'll getour wedding stylist
to help them out.

So we need to...

Spruce up our look?

No.

You gotta bruce up your look.

So Professor Tricia says that Letterkenny has developed
into quite the homosexual scene

and we can rightly expects
a Pride parades next springs.

Never been to a Pride parade.
What's it like?

It's like a Santa Claus parade.

Except instead of handing out candy,
they hand out condoms.

I should probably start
thinking about a name right now.

Great Day for gay.
A Hard Gay's Night.

Eyes Pride Shut.
Pride Green Tomatoes.

Pride of Chucky.
lndependence Gay.

Ferris Bueller Gets Off.

Star Wars Rogue One.

The Princess Pride.
Pride of Frankenstein.

Pride and Go Seeks.
Carlito's Gay.

Night of the Giving Head.
Lay Anything.

Final Mantasy.

Third Cock from the Sun.

How fella Got His Groove Pack.

The Gay the Earth Stood Still.

Eat, Gay, Love.

Dr. Strangelove

or how I learned
to stop wearing, "Love the Bum".

Bonnie and Pride.

Oh, Bonnie McMurray.

You boys tried the catering yet?

I am chomping at the bit
to get one of those cupcakes.

Nots to be impolite, Dary

but it's actually
champing at the bits.

Oh, you got those
pits ready for your fucking ponies?

How many ponies you got under your hood?
You got a frigging hemmy under there?

How many CCs is your sled?

Do you fucking pin her
when you get pickled there, bud?

Oh, I really fucking gave it
to her last night.

Working hard or hardly working?

What happenedto the part where...
We don't fight at weddings.

I gotta piss.
I'll come with you.

Yeah, same. Okay, let's go.

My cock he lives now. Redux.

What's up, ladies?

What is your nationality?

Grow up around here?

Have any tattoos?

I got a Celtic symbol
on my calf.

I got a Nike swoosh
right above my heart.

I got you a drink.
I swear it's not a roofie.

Yes, it is. Of course, it is.

Hey, that's a real nice dress.

Look a lot nicer
on my hotel room floor.

You ever seen the front seat
of a Honda del Sol?

I'll have a roll
in your hay any day.

We don't fight at weddings.

I got a Harman Kardon
system in the 3.

X3.BM motherfucking W, baby.

It's actually
way better than Bose.

Dickskin? Dickens.

Fellas, a list of my requests.

To be played back two, back two ,
three, four, well I have five songs...

No requests.

How dare thou come into
my private roost

of penetrating beats with an audacious act
of social and musical treason.

Every single one of these
is a Brooks and Dunn song.

Starting with
the Boot Scootin' Boogie.

I didn't realize
they had other songs.

Of all the boogies,the Boot Scootin'
is the last one I would

and will ever torture
myself or others with.

I'll give you a Boot Scootin'.

What about Blame lt on the Boogie
by the Jackson 5?

Boogie, Oogie, Oogie,
A taste of honey.

Boot Scootin'.Boogie Wonderland,
by Earth Wind & Fire.

Elton John'sStreet Boogie.

This wedding needs a boogie and
it's gonna be Boot Scootin'.

Born to Boogie, T Rex?

Boogie Woogie Wu,
lnsane Clown Posse.

Zip Gun Boogie, T Rex again.

Take the damn boogie
and make it a Boot Scootin'.

I'm Your Boogie Man,
KC and the Sunshine band.

I'm Your Boogieman,
White Zombie.

I hoped it wouldn't come
to blows over a boogie.

But I'll damn well go to blows.

For the Boot Scootin' Boogie.

Not happening, Dickskin.
Dickens!

I got it. I got it.

I got the Chicken Dance.

Went home and got it
out of the cassette player in the tractor.

You play it now or later.
Either way, you'll play it.

Or you'll die.

What's with the super sad
glassware, boys?

What's with your hair?

Oh, just got some
big city prospects.

Don't wanna risk putting a big goose egg
up on the board.

Don't wanna fan
on a yonny cage, buddy.

So, we bruced up our looks.

What does that mean?

Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it, yeah.

How's that going for ya?

Uh, good. We got bites.

Yeah.

Well, we got like, a... A bite.

They were 50 though.

I took downan older lady once.
It was kinda fun.

Kinda weird. Why?

Well, after she made a pizza.

Sick, buddy.
She ordered a pizza.

No, made a pizza.

From scratch, buddy.

I had to sit and talk

while she made a pizza.

You two look like dandies.

You look like pansies.

You know, the landscape
might be changing

but manly men
never go out of style.

Hello, ladies.

Yeuch, I can't drink
this shit anymore.

What am I a ballerina trying
to get skinny?

I'm gonna get some rye, babe.

Cheers.

Katy got hit on
by a top hat guy.

A top hat. A guy in a top hat.

I'd rather take down
a city than a guy in a top hat.

Oh, I don't know, Ms. Katys.

Some men looks
quite statelys in a top hat.

Scrooge McDuck comes to mind.

Mr. Peanut. Slash.

The guy from T Rex. Abe Lincoln.

Uncle Pennybags from Monopoly.
Willy Wonka's.

The Cat in the Hat.
Guy from T Rex again.

Oh, hey there, buds.

Is she a manual?
Or are you driving a bitch stick?

You like bud lite?
You like butt holes around here.

Oh, did you get your pecker stuck
in a bottle of brew?

Where's your sweety bud?

Did she leave you to your John
and your John Deere?

Where's your John queer, bud?

I was brought up on Looney Tunes and only dancing
when nobody's around.

Learned the heck
out of it that way, Dan.

I am fucking irritated.

We don't fight at weddings.

Right.

We don't fight at weddings.

Ten four? Over and out.

Hello, ladies. Ladies.

Can we interest you
in a shot of sourpuss?

Perhaps a half glass
of white zinfandel?

Have you looked at
any interesting furniture lately?

I admire his eye
for interior design.

What are you two going on about?

You are really missing the mark.

You know, metrosexuality
went out of style

with the Von Dutch and Chingy.

We are into men.
Classic men, athletic types.

You don't look like
you can fix my car.

You don't look like you can fix
a sliding screen door.

What? Wha... What?

We're ... We're hockey players.

We're the snipe, celly boys.

Dirty fucking dangles boys.

What are you guys
going on about now?

Now you are just being posers.
It's pretty pathetic.

Even if you are hockey players,
we are not puck bunnies.

Or lacrosse-titutes.

I don't even drink...
I drink beer.

Where are you guys
staying tonight?

There's only motel
in this shit hole, so that one.

I've never ridden
in a BMW X3 before.

What about a BMW X3
with a luxury leather package?

She just said she'd never ridden
in one, idiot.

Take me home.

Ladies and gentlemen.

The song for the first dance...

Chosen by...

The grooms.

I can't wait
to take sauce from you

and slot from now
until the horn blows

at the end
of quadruple overtime.

Playoff rules, nice.

There was always an open bet.

I'll take the tender tonight.

A six man, you know
what I am talking about.

As long as you can bury.
Oh, we will find a hole.

You can't slip one past me.
Let's steer this back.
Well, Halloween isn't s'bad.

Bit fuckin' green and lush around here

- for end of October, isn't it?
- Hmm.

Yeah. Al Gores mights be onto something.

Devil's night, boys.

And you know the shit heads'll
be out causing mischief.

- Can't scare me.
- Yeah, we know.

You can try though. 'Cause
that's the fun of it.

- Wayne's?
- Squirrelly Dan?

Speakins of mischiefs.
My cousin, Samuel...

You mean speakin' of shit heads?

Is very sorry for whats
he did last Halloweens.

What'd Samuel do this time?

He stole candy from his little sister.

Oh! The little... Fucker!

See, that's what I say, I
said, "Oh! Little... Fucker."

Samuel's very sorry for whats he dids

and hes likes to come by to
show you his costumes this year.

Samuel knows the deal!

But... but Samuel's going
out dressed as his heroes

and he wants to come by...

Poor behavior is not to be
rewarded, it's to be punished.

And Samuel is not welcome by

for a full-sized chocolate
bar this Halloween.

I'm with you, big brother.

Or one kinda feels like we
should maybe be discussing

the origins of Halloween.

Like talking about the history of it.

Like, I mean, before
we start celebrating

the bastardized North
American version of things.

Well, look who's pooped
the pumpkin. Shocker.

From where I'm sittin',
looks like you're curled up

nice and cozy with the
bastardized, North American

North American version of it, Wayne.

What's the problem, Dary?

For someone who doesn't even like kids,

you got a lot of nerve big-league'n

the rest of the town handing
out full-sized chocolate bars.

Yeah, well, you got a
lot of nerve back-doorin'

trick or treaters by handing
out quarter-size chocolate bars

- on Halloween.
- Get off your wallet, Dary.

I'll get off my wallet when he
quits throwing around nickels

like they're manhole covers.

Geez, this one won'ts gets
off his wallet, and this one's

tossing around nickels like
they're manholes covers.

Know what? There's 5000
people in Letterkenny,

and do you wanna know what
their problem is? Wayne.

- Big-league'n them.
- Haven't you ever heard of the expression,

"do unto others as you
would have them do unto you"?

'Ain't you never heard
of the expression,

"Do unto others before
they do unto you"?

You're fuckin' up, bud.

364 days of the year this guy's all,

"Oh, I don't give a
shit about your kids."

And, "Somebody should hit Samuel."

"Somebody should hit Samuel."

And then comes Halloween you
gotta big-league everybody

by handin' out
full-sized chocolate bars.

- Get off your wallet, Dary.
- What's in your jeans, bud?

You know, the whole town's
talkin' about how you

big-league them. It's all I'm sayin'

Yeah, well, all the
trick-or-treaters talk about

how you back-doored
them. It's all I'm sayin'.

I'll back door you like I
back-doored those trick-or-treaters.

Maybe we should establish
some context here, boys.

Get your mind out of the gutter.

But Samuels...

Samuel is not welcome to come

for a full-sized chocolate
bar this Halloween.

That's mighty charitable of you, Wayne.

That's one last set of
parents you're big-league'n.

Yeah, well, that's one
more trick-or-treater

that you're back-doorin'.

I'll back-door those
trick-or-treaters

like I back-doored you.

Okay. You know what?

Maybe we should establish
some context here.

Get your mind outta the gutter!

Well, she's lookin' a wee bit more

like October now, isn't it?

Why does Gailer want us here so early?

She didn't say.

Ooh! I hope it's for an early sample

of one of her harvest rotating taps.

Can't legally serves beer
for another hour, bud.

Ah, there goes Dary back-doorin'
the Liquor Control Board.

Well, there goes Wayne, big-league'n me

before I even had a
beer. Par for the course.

She sounded rattled.

When a friend asks
for help you help 'em.

Gailer.

Happy Halloweens, Gailer.

- You hung-over?
- No. Why?

You got a glass of water there.
A bit of fresh air will do it.

It's holy water.

Is that what it is?

Dear me, no. I love a good horror movie.

We know!

I love a good scare.

We know!

- Guess what.
- Chicken butt.

MoDean's 2 is haunted.

- No, it isn't.
- Is, too.

- No, it isn't.
- Is, too.

No, it isn't!

Follow me now!

What ya notice?

Hmm.

Uncle Eddie's Pig Hoof hops ale.

- He was a good guy.
- He was a great guy.

He's come back from the
dead for one more go.

Tried to get me to drink
that shite with him in bed.

You took down Uncle Eddie.

Mmm-hmm. Took him down once.

- How was that for ya?
- Ecstasy.

Why only once?

'Cause he died shortly after.

- He died in his nineties.
- Yeah.

What are you doin' takin'
down geriatrics, Gail?

What, you never met no one
with a geri-care fetish before?

The fuck outta here...

Mmm...

So, you think Uncle Eddie
is haunting MoDean's 2

I know he's haunting MoDean's 2.

There's his Pig Hoof
hops front and center.

- Gail's right.
- Pardon?

Well, how else do you explains this?

Literally one million ways.

Could be a ghost or a ghoul or a spirit,

or a phantom, or an orb, ecto-mist,

poltergeist, angel, archangel,

a demon... Elemental?

No, it isn't.

Oh, it's a ghost.

It might fall under one of
the many sub-ghosts categories.

You got your vengefuls,
you got your hungries,

you got your residuals,
you got your messengers,

you got your inanimates,
uh, you got your artificials,

animals, childs.

Then you have all your
different types of lady ghosts.

You got your ladies in
red, ladies in white,

ladies in black, ladies
in blue, ladies in purple,

ladies in vermilion, ladies
in the burnt orange sienna's.

Then you got your Bloody Mary...

We're not even getting into
Japanese ghosts. Holy jeez.

No, you don't!

Spirit energy doesn't just
goes away, Wayne. It circulates.

What is it, cowboy?

Let me make a call.

Oh... Bonnie McMurray.

Great costumes there, Bonnie.

You got yourselfs some
attentive students right here.

Yeah, I'm reformed.

You can hit me one more time, baby.

Costume?

- Bonnie.
- Wayne.

Did you make your angel
food cupcakes for the annual

Catholic school alumnae
bake sale to raise

much-needed funds for the
missionary trip to Nicaragua?

Sure did, Wayne.

Good for you. Enjoy yourself.

I will.

Woolwich Taffy Cone Harvest
I.P.A. from Wellesley, Ontario.

Boastful, yet reserved.

Opinionated. Selective.

Elmira maple syrup,
Skinner Farms smoked bacon.

Hmm... Tastes like a tragedy
occurred while making breakfast.

Takers?

Let's get this guy a fuckin' Puppers.

Don't minds if I do's.

- So, you think it's us, boys?
- Why boys?

'Cause last night was devil's night.

And you're shit heads.

Oh, okay, so you think we're
playing pranks now, huh?

Well, it's clear there is a unique
brand of tom fuckery at play.

I haven't smashed a pumpkin
on someone's doorstep

since grade nine, boys.

I haven't stuffed an egg up a tailpipe

since grade eight, boys.

I haven't silly-stringed
a car since grade seven.

I haven't TP'd a tree since grade six.

Yeah, but do's you's have an alibi?

We definitely have alibis.

I'm glad you asked about alibis.

We've prepared a
powerpoint presentation.

Jonesy prepare the
powerpoint presentation.

Haunting took place between
the hours of 3 a.m. and 9 a.m.

And I was taking down this swipey snipey

between the hours of 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.

And I was taking down this swipey snipey

between the hours of 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.

Nice work, boys.

Wait a minute. That's only three hours.

What were you doing between
the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 a.m.?

I'm glad you asked.

This is where things got
a little complicated, boys.

Reilly's swipey snipey hit me
up after taking down Reilly.

Jonesy's swipey snipey hit me
up after taking down Jonesy.

Accidental tunnel buddies, ferda.

Ferda.

How did you guys figure that out?

Well, we facetimed each other
from the swipey snipies beds.

After the take down.

This is exactly what Uncle Eddie wanted.

Get me thinkin' about take downs.

Sure as I flick, it's a
ghost doing this trick.

No, it isn't.

Then what is it, cowboy?

Let me make a call.

ALL GASPING

Oh, Bonnie McMurray.

Great costumes, Bonnie.

My soldier's standing at attentions.

Locked and loaded.

Two gun salute.

- Ready to shoot.
- Costume?

- Bonnie?
- Wayne.

Did you cadets make up
your hearty harvest chili

for the annual potluck supper

for our amputee war
vets in the cancer ward?

Sure did, Wayne.

Good for you. Enjoy yourselfs.

I will.

Oka. Old style harvest
pilsner from Kahnawake, Quebec.

Proud. Fearless. Defensive.
Loyal. Knows its history.

Tastes like an upset
shamans horded collection

of spunky backwoods fruit. Takers?

Get this guy a fuckin' Puppers.

Don't minds if I do.

You's think this is an Indian haunting?

You's watch too many shitty movies.

Well, no one's implyings that,

but we're just coverings our bases.

You still have a rich history
of tom fuckery in this town

and that can't be denied.

Well, is this place built on
an ancient Indian burial ground?

Not to my knowledge.

Did you find a tomahawk
lodged in your door?

Not yet. No.

Did you wake up with moccasins
at the foot of your bed?

But is that a thing? Because it...

Okay! Just get yourselves
a couple of dream catchers

and stop watching shitty horror movies.

ALL GASPING

Okay, do I actually
have to explain this?

You'd better go home and
change or I will fight you!

- Bonnie?
- Wayne?

On your way to the
protest rally up country,

to provide glaring examples
of cultural appropriation

for people who don't understand
cultural appropriation,

- but probably should?
- Sure am, Wayne.

Good for you. Enjoy yourself.

I will.

Did ya see that?

It moved.

Gail, the building just shifted.

It was probably the shelves
expanding due to the heat.

Or the shelves contracting
because of the cold,

being that it is October.

It's Uncle Eddie. He wants
me to take him down again.

Set his jar of Pig Hoof hops
right there front and center!

No, it isn't. And no he
doesn't. And no he didn't.

- What is it?
- Literally, five hundred million things.

Mossif. Run it!

Let me make a call...

Hellmich Premium Blonde Harvest
Ale from Mitchell, Ontario?

Hardworking, cooperative,
tough in the corners.

Zurich bean off the top with
a strathroy turkey finish...

The dark meat.

That tastes like wheat from the field

of a stay-at-home defenseman.
A la Travis Hamonic, anybody?

Let's get this guy a fuckin' Puppers.

Don'ts minds if I do.

Ha! The glass.

We've heard talks of apparitions.

Specters. Wraiths.

Demons...

Uncle Eddie's back for one
more go with this old goat.

Unclegedly.

We believe this to be true.

- Collectively.
- Conclusively.

Are you sure you guys didn't
just come in here and do all this?

Breaking and entering?

There are far more gratifying crimes

with far leaner sentences.

Also it's a sin. So no, we didn't.

So?

I will perform a seance
to summon Uncle Eddie.

Speak with him. Reason
with him if I must.

Though I will be reluctant
to cooperate with him.

I promise you that.

- K.
- Uncle Eddie will enter Roald's body and...

Wait. One more time?

Uncle Eddie will enter Roald's body.

Then I will exorcise his spirit.

Is that what you'll do.

Christ permitting, yes.

One question. I...

Yes. I... I wanna... I
wanna be really clear here.

So, Stewart you're going
to summon the spirit

of Uncle Eddie, who's
going to enter Roald

and then from there you're
gonna communicate with him?

Precisely.

Though, again, I will be
reluctant to cooperate with him.

We heard you, Stewart.

This I promise you.

And, Glen...

Hey Wayne, hos that girlfriend
of yours doing? I miss her.

I like her. She's like
a li'l baby Halle Berry.

Like a li'l baby Beyonce. Like a...

Oh!

That's a Beyonce seance-ay!

So, Uncle Eddie's spirit
is going to enter Roald

and then Glen is going to exorcise it.

That's right. I will exorcise
the spirit out of Roald

and cast it into hell!

Hell?

- He was a good guy.
- He was a great guy.

Begging your pardon, but anybody
that comes back from the dead

to have non-consensual
sexual relations with a woman,

outside of wedlock, may
I add, is not a good guy!

Good enough.

Now we must all hold hands.

No!

- Fine.
- Wayne...

Roald, Glen... Roald.

Stewart.

- Roald.
- Glen.

- Roald!
- Stewart.

- Roald!
- Glen!

- Roald!
- Stewart!

- Roald
- Glen!

- Roald!
- Stewart.

Oh...

Now we need five seconds of silence

while Lucifer locates us.

Sorrys, that was the ghost
of yesterday's dinner.

Honestly!

Five seconds of silence
to beckon Beelzebub!

Sorry, you give me a stage like
that I'm gonna have to dazzle.

Five seconds of silence
while Satan substantiates.

What... What was that one?

Control your bum. Be a lady.

That came out my front bum.

Oh, no.

Was that a queef?

Soundeds like a queef.

- Quiff.
- Okay!

I think there's something wrong.

- Stewart!
- How are you doing that?

I don't know.

It's very freaky.

I know.

- Are you scared?
- I'm very scared.

Okay everybody. Five
more seconds of silence.

No farting, or burping...

Blah...

Maybe... Maybe it'll go away.

And try again.

Roald!

Argh!

No, no...

Jesus Christ.

He has nothing to do
with it, but oh my gourd!

Exorcise him, Glen!

What? I don't know how to do that!

I did not think it would come up.

Stop! How are you doing that?

- I don't know.
- Stop doing that.

It's like we flipped the
wrong button or something.

There are no buttons.

Could we hit a circuit breaker maybe?

Maybe there's just a frog in my throat.

Here let me try and cough it out.

Is it gone?

Oh, no, no...

Oh, no...

Stewart! Glen! Stewart! Glen!

You wanna know what?
My friend, Sean Amsing,

has a Halloween party in the
city before Halloween every year

and he calls it
Premature E-Jacu-Lantern.

- That's good.
- Clever.

I likes that.

He's a really funny guy.

Oh... Bonnie McMurray.

Well, now that has gots to be a costume.

Christ, she could make a softball hard.

She could play on my field.

Dingers all day, boys.

- Bonnie?
- Wayne?

You on your way to the
annual Jeff Davies Memorial

baseball tournament to raise money

for pit bull puppy mill rescue?

Sure am, Wayne.

Good for you. Enjoy yourself.

I will.

- Is that this weekend?
- Yeah, it's this weekend.

- Jeff was a good guy.
- Jeff was a greats guy.

- Jeff was a babe.
- One of the greatest. Jeff fuckin' Davies.

I feel like Jeff would know what to do.

I feel like Jeff would want
to make... One more call...

That is not a regulation
softball uniform.

Hmm. Delicious.

You know when you can't
see what you're tasting,

your sense of taste gets heightened.

I bet you didn't know
that, did you, Dan?

I did know that, Dary.

'Cause one times I took a gals
on a date to one of them places

in the city where they don't
gots any lights, and you have

to eats in the dark. Made
a fuckin' mess of myself.

I've been to one of those places.

All the servers there are
blind. Bet you didn't know that.

So the blind are eating better
than us, eh? Must be nice.

Yeah, on accounts that their
sense of taste is heightened

'cause they can't sees nothin'.

There's always a silver lining there.

No. Not at all.

McMurray, how're ya?

Good' n' you?

Just... I can't see a fuckin'
thing in here McMurray.

Well, that's the only
way to catch a ghost,

that's all I know. What've
you got for gin there, Gailer?

Don't know 'cause I can't see the bar.

Well, I'd get into one of them
cocksuckers when you locate it.

We're not convinced that
it's a ghost, McMurray.

You'd better believe it's a ghost, Katy.

What else could it be?

Literally five hundred million things.

Well, luckys for yous
guys Mrs. McMurray and I

went down 'Minican one
year, hopped on over

to the Aztec pyramids and
got ourselves on a guided tour

with some genuine ghost hunters.

There they taught us everything
they goddamn know, okay?

We've guided tours down 'Pulco,
we've guided tours down 'Cacos.

- We've guided tours down 'Cun.
- Pitter patter.

All right. You's guys
see this in my hand?

No!

This here is a genuine
SB-9 ghost talkie,

- transmits ghost speak.
- Oh, is that what it does?

Mmm-hmm.

Mmm-hmm. You fire it up and
when the ghosts start talking

you can hear what they're
saying. Fire it up, babe.

Lemony Snickets, babe. We
got activity off the charts.

Did you hear that?

Wasn't this clear in 'Pulco.

Nothing like this down in 'Cun either.

They'd kill for this down 'Cun!

McMurray is such a piece of shit.

Oh! McMurray's a huge piece of shit.

What the devil?

You'll never meet a bigger piece of shit

in your life than McMurray.

Oh! Yeah, what a piece of shit!

Jimmy dong bobby baby.

What, baby?

I grabbed the wrong box.

This here's one half of the
high-frequency baby radio

that I set up in the break-room
in the barn to make sure

the farmhands wasn't
talking shits about me.

It would appear that
your farmhands are talking

significant shit about you, McMurray.

What a piece of shit he is, eh?

I mean, how does a piece of
shit like that land a woman

like Mrs. McMurray?

Ah! Tell you what I'd
do with Mrs. McMurray...

Baby?

Yeah, baby?

Remember the lawyer that
took the case that time

I shot at the worm pickers
when they were on the property?

Yeah, baby. You almost caught
one of them cock-suckers, too.

Just missed him by a sminch.

- By a sminch. Best give 'em a call.
- Why, baby?

'Cause I, McMurray,
am about to kill a man.

Hear me now. You need
to drink it, Daryl.

Hear me now. Not on your life, Gailer.

It's the only thing we haven't tried.

No, it isn't.

Then what, Wayne? What
else can we try here?

Literally, 5,500 billion things.

Uncle Eddie wanted me
to drink it with him

after I took him down! But I didn't.

It's the only thing left to
do to get rid of his ghost.

So drink it you fuckin' pussy!

- No.
- Yes.

- No.
- Yes.

- Huh?
- Yes.

- No.
- Hey!

When a friend asks you
for help you help them.

No.

I'd do it for you.

No...

Wait!

- Gail.
- Wayne.

- It was me.
- What was you?

I know how much you love Halloween.

I know how much you love Halloween.

Well, see, there ya go.

It was only my intention to
give you a bit of a thrill,

and have a little bit of fun
with all the nutsacks in town.

It was never my intention
to get you this riled up.

And boy do I ever wish I
wouldn't have discovered

you took down my 90
plus year-old Uncle.

That's when things
took a real hard detour.

- Wayne?
- Gail.

It was a thrill!

What is that?

Oh!

Ha! You do scare!

Waynes, why are you so
scared? It's only Samuels.

Dan!

Now hold your horses there, Waynes.

Samuel's here has somethings
that he'd like to says to yous.

Samuel, you have the floor.

I'm sorry I stole the
full-sized chocolate bar

you gave my little
sister last Halloween.

I accept your apologies, Samuel.

I was sick of Daryl back doorin' me

with the quarter chocolate bars.

I understand that, Samuel,
but that doesn't make it right.

I trust you've apologized to
your little sister as well?

Yes, sir.

And now my friend David
wants me to say thanks for him

for big league-n the
cheap-skate beat-skates in town

who gave out half chocolate bars.

Please tell your friend,
David, I'm more than happy

to big league cheap-skate
beat-skates like Daryl.

But, Samuel, big brothers are to

look out for their little sisters.

- Yes, sir.
- You only get one family, Samuel.

You are to treat them
with love and respect.

I've learned my lesson, sir.

Good. And to make sure
you've learned your lesson,

you will not be receiving
a full-sized chocolate bar

from your Uncle Wayne this Halloween.

Yes, sir.

Now, Waynes, remember when
I said that Samuel wanted

to show you his costumes this year?

That's because Samuel wanted
to go dressed as his hero's

for Halloween.

Who's your hero, Samuels?

Wayne.

Samuel. I didn't say we couldn't split

a full-sized chocolate
bar this Halloween.

Choco-coconut? Coconut's
fuckin' gross, asshole.
